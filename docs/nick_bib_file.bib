annote = {Present a number of observed regularities, then offer a model of what is going on.Most are irrelevant, but remember in general that there is a "reflection rule": our habits towards risk for gains (like risk aversion) are the opposite as they are for losses (which tend to show risk loving behavior). Evaluation has two stages: editing, and evaluation. In Editing, a decision problem is simplified through the following processes (Note that none of these matter in expected utility, but influence choice in presense of biases): 1) Coding: pick a reference point, and decide if results are gains or losses with respect to a reference point? 2) Combination: can some things be grouped, like who winning 200 with p=0.25 if a dice comes up 1 or 2 can be lumped into a single outcome of winning 200 with p=0.5. 3) Segretation: If something is common to all choices (like a gain of $500), consider that the "riskless component", and separate it the "risky component". 4) Cancellation: Ignore things that are common to all options. EVALUATION: has two parts -- evaluation of outcomes, and weighting of probabilities (which are "warped" in a sense) Value Function: 1) defined on deviations from reference point. 2) generally concave for gains and convex for losses (authors say that in theory shape could vary depending on initial reference point, for example becoming more linear with wealth, but that ignoring that gets close enough). 3) Steeper for losses than gains. Decision Weights: Function of probabilities, but distinct. Generally, overweight small probabilities and underweight normal probabilities. Generally sum to something less than one oddly (subcertainty, which implies less sensitivity to most probabilities than expected by expected utility). Note this is underweighting, not underESTIMATING. Monotonic in actual probabilities. They say that weights are very poorly behaved near endpoints, given observed preference for certainty and difficulty in ESTIMATING low probabilties.}

annote = {Present a number of observed regularities, then offer a model of what is going on.Most are irrelevant, but remember in general that there is a "reflection rule": our habits towards risk for gains (like risk aversion) are the opposite as they are for losses (which tend to show risk loving behavior). Evaluation has two stages: editing, and evaluation. In Editing, a decision problem is simplified through the following processes (Note that none of these matter in expected utility, but influence choice in presense of biases): 1) Coding: pick a reference point, and decide if results are gains or losses with respect to a reference point? 2) Combination: can some things be grouped, like who winning 200 with p=0.25 if a dice comes up 1 or 2 can be lumped into a single outcome of winning 200 with p=0.5. 3) Segretation: If something is common to all choices (like a gain of $500), consider that the "riskless component", and separate it the "risky component". 4) Cancellation: Ignore things that are common to all options. EVALUATION: has two parts -- evaluation of outcomes, and weighting of probabilities (which are "warped" in a sense) Value Function: 1) defined on deviations from reference point. 2) generally concave for gains and convex for losses (authors say that in theory shape could vary depending on initial reference point, for example becoming more linear with wealth, but that ignoring that gets close enough). 3) Steeper for losses than gains. Decision Weights: Function of probabilities, but distinct. Generally, overweight small probabilities and underweight normal probabilities. Generally sum to something less than one oddly (subcertainty, which implies less sensitivity to most probabilities than expected by expected utility). Note this is underweighting, not underESTIMATING. Monotonic in actual probabilities. They say that weights are very poorly behaved near endpoints, given observed preference for certainty and difficulty in ESTIMATING low probabilties.}

a 2008 investigative series on National Public Radio, some Texas sheriffs{\textquoteright} departments rely on forfeited money for up to one-third of their budgets.30

Criminologist John Worrall surveyed 770 police managers and executives and found that almost 40 percent of respondents agreed or strongly agreed with the statement that civil forfeiture is {\textquotedblleft}necessary as a budget supplement{\textquotedblright} (emphasis added).37

Evaluation has two stages: editing, and evaluation. In Editing, a decision problem is simplified through the following processes (Note that none of these matter in expected utility, but influence choice in presense of biases): 1) Coding: pick a reference point, and decide if results are gains or losses with respect to a reference point? 2) Combination: can some things be grouped, like who winning 200 with p=0.25 if a dice comes up 1 or 2 can be lumped into a single outcome of winning 200 with p=0.5. 3) Segretation: If something is common to all choices (like a gain of $500), consider that the "riskless component", and separate it the "risky component". 4) Cancellation: Ignore things that are common to all options. EVALUATION: has two parts -- evaluation of outcomes, and weighting of probabilities (which are "warped" in a sense) Value Function: 1) defined on deviations from reference point. 2) generally concave for gains and convex for losses (authors say that in theory shape could vary depending on initial reference point, for example becoming more linear with wealth, but that ignoring that gets close enough). 3) Steeper for losses than gains. Decision Weights: Function of probabilities, but distinct. Generally, overweight small probabilities and underweight normal probabilities. Generally sum to something less than one oddly (subcertainty, which implies less sensitivity to most probabilities than expected by expected utility). Note this is underweighting, not underESTIMATING. Monotonic in actual probabilities. They say that weights are very poorly behaved near endpoints, given observed preference for certainty and difficulty in ESTIMATING low probabilties.}

annote = {Present a number of observed regularities, then offer a model of what is going on.Most are irrelevant, but remember in general that there is a "reflection rule": our habits towards risk for gains (like risk aversion) are the opposite as they are for losses (which tend to show risk loving behavior).


Evaluation has two stages: editing, and evaluation.

In Editing, a decision problem is simplified through the following processes (Note that none of these matter in expected utility, but influence choice in presense of biases):

1) Coding: pick a reference point, and decide if results are gains or losses with respect to a reference point?

2) Combination: can some things be grouped, like who winning 200 with p=0.25 if a dice comes up 1 or 2 can be lumped into a single outcome of winning 200 with p=0.5.

3) Segretation: If something is common to all choices (like a gain of $500), consider that the "riskless component", and separate it the "risky component".

4) Cancellation: Ignore things that are common to all options.

EVALUATION: has two parts -- evaluation of outcomes, and weighting of probabilities (which are "warped" in a sense)

Value Function:
1) defined on deviations from reference point.

2) generally concave for gains and convex for losses (authors say that in theory shape could vary depending on initial reference point, for example becoming more linear with wealth, but that ignoring that gets close enough).

3) Steeper for losses than gains.

Decision Weights:
Function of probabilities, but distinct. Generally, overweight small probabilities and underweight normal probabilities. Generally sum to something less than one oddly (subcertainty, which implies less sensitivity to most probabilities than expected by expected utility). Note this is underweighting, not underESTIMATING. Monotonic in actual probabilities.

They say that weights are very poorly behaved near endpoints, given observed preference for certainty and difficulty in ESTIMATING low probabilties.

Defines ambivalence as (a) similar but opposite evaluations along positive and negative dimensions, which (b) are also both strong.
